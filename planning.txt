Goal: Using a Raspberry pi to provide feedback using sensors and other analog/digital inputs to provide useful data in testing, future designing, and car setup for the JMS Baja. This will be done both in real time via a typical car based cluster view and in post time in which the raw data can further be analysed.

Sensor List: 
    4x accelerometer (one at each corner) 
        ADXL345 Digital Accelerometer Adafruit
    1x Gyroscope (centrally mounted)
    6x temperature sensors (4 brakes, two extras)
        MVP9808 High Accuracy I2C Temperature Sensor Adafruit
    2x position (accel and brake)
    1x tachometer from engine

Implementation Details:
